    "# Assignment 2\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this assignment you will build the first stage of a biomedical event extractor. Biomedical events are state changes of biomolecules. For example, if you have a protein and you add a phosphate (PO4) group to it, this is referred to as a phosphorylation event. Many papers in the biomedical literature mention such events. The grand goal of biomedical event extraction is to teach machines how to read this literature and produce structured representations of biomedical events that biomedical researchers can query effectively. This task has received considerable attention in the NLP literature, and is the topic of a biennial [shared task](http://2011.bionlp-st.org/). We will use the data from this task as starting point for this assignment.   \n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate biomedical event extraction, let us consider an example. From the sentence \n",
    "\n",
    "> **phosphorylation** of TRAF2 **inhibits** **binding** to the CD40 domain\n",
    "\n",
    "we could extract the structure \n",
    "\n",
    "> Negative_Regulation(Phosphorylation(TRAF2), Binding(TRAF2, CD40)\n",
    "\n",
    "and store it in a database. Someone can then query this database, for example, to figure out all ways to prevent binding of TRAF2 to CD40.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is often divided into two steps. First you need to find **trigger** words in the sentence that correspond to biomedical events, and determine their event type *label*. For example, in the above sentence \"phosphorylation\" is a trigger word for an event of type \"Phosphorylation\", \"inhibits\" a trigger word for a \"Negative Regulation\" event, and \"binding\" a trigger for a \"Binding\" event. Notice that sometimes the type labels are obvious, but often they are not. Also note that the label of a word could be \"None\". For example, the word \"of\" in the above sentence has the label \"None\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "The second step requires the extractor to produce **argument relations** between event triggers and protein mentions or other event triggers. For example, in the above case the argument of \"phosphorylation\" is \"TRAF2\", and one argument of \"inhibits\" is \"phosphorylation of TRAF2\" whereas the other is \"binding to the CD40 domain\". In this assignment you **do not have to do this**. We will focus on the event trigger detection problem exclusively. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "Your goal is to develop an event trigger labeler. This extractor is given a sentence and a candidate token. Both constitute the input $\\x$. One such input could be: \n",
    "\n",
    "> $\\x$: phosphorylation of TRAF2 **inhibits** binding to the CD40 domain\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to predict the label $y$ of the candidate event trigger. In the above case the label would be $y=\\text{Negative_Regulation}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some candidates may not refer to event triggers at all. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $\\x$: phosphorylation **of** TRAF2 inhibits binding to the CD40 domain\n",
    "\n",
    "In such cases the label is $y=\\text{None}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resources\n",
    "To develop your model you have access to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The data in `data/bionlp/train`. This data can be split into training and dev set (as done below), or used for cross-validation.\n",
    "* Helper code stored in the python module [bio.py](/edit/statnlpbook/bio.py).\n",
    "* Libraries on the [docker image](https://github.com/uclmr/stat-nlp-book/blob/python/Dockerfile) which contains everything in [this image](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/scipy-notebook), including scikit-learn and tensorflow. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we have to run the notebooks of all students, and because writing efficient code is important, **your notebook should run in 5 minutes at most**, on your machine. Further comments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We have tested a possible solution on the Azure VMs and it ran in about 30s, so it is possible to train a reasonable model on the data in reasonable time. If you find training times too long for your development cycle you can reduce the training set size. Once you have found a good solution you can increase the size again. Caveat: model parameters tuned on a smaller dataset may not be optimal for a larger training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Try to run your parameter optimisation offline, such that in your answer notebook the best parameters are already set and don't need to be searched. Include your optimisation code in the notebook, but don't call it at each notebook run."

   "source": [
    "## Hint\n",
    "While you do not need to predict the arguments of an event, it is important to understand how trigger labels relate to the syntactic and semantic arguments of the trigger word. Features that can capture this relation might help you in improving the result. Do inspect the data and try to get an understanding of it. That said, you don't have to be a biomedical expert to do well in this task. A few of the best results on the task were achieved by NLP researchers without any biomedical experience. They would, however, still inspect the data carefully.  "

    "In this assignment we were tasked with developing a biomedical event extractor, focusing on designing a set of features assigning weights to observations. These features were then fed to a logistic regression (LR) classification model to predict labels in 10 categories. SVM could be applied instead of LR, however results are largely similar. Other models, like Decision Trees or Neural Networks, could be attempted but would require more data and wouldn’t provide opportunity for feature engineering. The models performance was assessed using precision and recall metrics, combined into the F1 score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data exploration aided the selection of optimal features and model parameters. Almost 90% of all event candidates were labelled as ‘None’ and the least frequent  labels accounted for only fractions of a percent of the data (Protein-Catabolism 0.14%). Therefore, a ‘balanced’ version of the LR model was used, where weights are inversely proportional to the frequency of label occurrence. The regularisation strength parameter (C) was tuned and set to and optimal 1.25. This yelled a significant improvement in F1 as compared with the default LR implementation. Candidate arguments were also explored statistically, looking at the presence of stop-words, most common words and their stems. Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency statistics were also calculated. The stop-word ‘of’ was used as a trigger word many times and categorised as ‘none’ in almost all cases. For each label category, characteristic words were identified and features were designed to add additional weights to these. However, this did not improve the F1 score, signifying this was done implicitly by the LR model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Numerous feature functions have been trailed before proposing the final solution; features related to trigger words and proteins had the highest impact on model performance. Features quantifying the trigger: word, length, POS children and parents were implemented. For proteins; amount and type were counted together with the children they had. The number of protein parents detracted from the F1 score.The overall amount of event candidate arguments also improved predictions, even if not all were ‘true’ argument candidates. Contrary to expectations, features focusing on the presence, position and POS of the Head reduced F1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Analysis :\n",
    "From the confusion matrix below; my model performed worst for predicting the Regulation label (F1=48%) closely followed by other regulation-related labels (Negative-regulation F1=56%, Positive-regulation F1=58%). Despite the relatively large amount of training data as compared to other classes, these three labels relate to ‘regulation’ and share similarities. Features aimed at assigning extra weight to specific rare words in these classes did not improve results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model would perform better if less data was classified as ‘None’. To improve this, ‘of’ and similar words shouldn’t be flagged as triggers but changing this is outside of the assignment’s scope. Instead, I attempted to down-weight the probabilities assigned to the 'None' label by the LR model using thresholding. Further tuning probabilities on all 10 classes could improve F1 but I run out of time to implement this.\n"
