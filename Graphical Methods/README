In this repo I share work undertaken as part of the Graphical Models course at UCL.
This consisted of 4 group courseworks, each one involving solving a set of tasks from the course textbook.
The relevant book for this course is also included (http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/textbook/090310.pdf)
Code is mainly in MATLAB
